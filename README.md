The Neven Vision face detector from Android

And some very messy code from about 10 years ago to call it and extract each face into a separate output file.

## Usage

```
./pic file.jpg file2.jpg ...
```

creates a directory called `out` and puts the faces, if any,
from the source JPEGs into that directory.
